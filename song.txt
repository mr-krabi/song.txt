I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade
It doesn't cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts
Go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth
With all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
Undone, it has begun
I'm not the only one
